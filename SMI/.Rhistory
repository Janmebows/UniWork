####Price ----
##Cleaning -
#this should be a number so "NA" chars are removed
gumtree$price[gumtree$price=="NA"]=NA
class(gumtree$price)
#class is changed to numeric
gumtree$price=as.numeric(gumtree$price)
#since price is a quantitative, continuous variable, a histogram is appropriate
ggplot(gumtree,aes(x = price)) +
geom_histogram(col = "black", fill = "orange") +
labs(x = "Price of dog in dollars.")
#This graph is right - skewed, which suggests price is right skewed
#it has a single peak which suggests it is unimodal
##cross ----
#told to ignore the "Cross" (uppercase) section and use the "cross" (lowercase)
#interesting note:
length(which(gumtree$Cross!=gumtree$cross)) #gives 635 -> that means 635 values are different!
#cross is chr which is good
class(gumtree$cross)
#nas are changed so R can read them
gumtree$cross[gumtree$cross=="NA"]=NA
#since cross has two states, yes and no, a bar chart is more appropriate
ggplot(gumtree,aes(x = cross)) +
geom_bar(col = "black", fill = "orange") +
labs(x = "Is the dog cross bred?")
#clearly a greater portion is not cross bred
##Pet offered by ----
gumtree$"Pet Offered By:"[gumtree$"Pet Offered By:"=="NA"]=NA
ggplot(gumtree,aes(x = gumtree$'Pet Offered By:')) +
geom_bar(col = "black", fill = "orange") +
labs(x = "Pet Offered By")
#a majority of the pets were offered by an owner.
##Microchip ----
gumtree$micro[gumtree$micro=="NA"]=NA
#na.rm is not working here for some reason
ggplot(gumtree,aes(x = micro)) +
geom_bar(col = "black", fill = "orange", na.rm = TRUE) +
labs(x = "Has the dog been microchipped")
#most fields are NA, but few to no dogs are not microchipped
##Vaccination ----
gumtree$vacc[gumtree$vacc=="NA"]=NA
#na.rm is not working here for some reason
ggplot(gumtree,aes(x=vacc))+
geom_bar(col = "black", fill = "orange", na.rm=TRUE) +
labs(x = "Has the dog been vaccinated")
#A very small percentage are labelled as not vaccinated, and most are vaccinated.
##Desexing ----
gumtree$desex[gumtree$desex=="NA"]=NA
#na.rm is not working here for some reason
ggplot(gumtree,aes(x=desex))+
geom_bar(col = "black", fill = "orange", na.rm=TRUE) +
labs(x = "Has the dog been desexed")
##Relinquished ----
gumtree$relinquished[gumtree$relinquished=="NA"]=NA
ggplot(gumtree,aes(x = relinquished)) +
geom_bar(col = "black", fill = "orange", na.rm=TRUE) +
labs(x = "Is the dog being relinquished?")
#Most dogs have been relinquished
